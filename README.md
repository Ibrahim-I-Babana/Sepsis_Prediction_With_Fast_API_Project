### **ðŸ“Š Sepsis Prediction with FastAPI ðŸš€** ###

**Welcome to the Sepsis Prediction with FastAPI Project! Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection, leading to organ dysfunction and failure. Early detection of sepsis is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a predictive model for sepsis detection in patients within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) using various input features such as plasma glucose level, blood work results, blood pressure, body mass index, patient's age, and insurance status.**


### **Business Understanding** ###

**The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that assists healthcare professionals in assessing the likelihood of sepsis development based on key clinical indicators. The model's predictions will enable healthcare providers to identify patients at higher risk of sepsis, facilitating prompt and targeted medical interventions.**

**Analyzing the distribution of different features between patients with and without sepsis can have several business implications in a healthcare setting:**

**1. Identification of risk factors**

**2. Targeted intervention strategies**

**3. Resource allocation**

**4. Quality improvement initiatives**

**5. Cost management**
